#reverse

###Overview

Reverses array so that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes the second to last, and so on.

###Technical Explanation

Reverse iterates through array datatypes and uses the javascript built in unshift to place the last last element into first and the second element second. 


###Code Examples

```var array = [1, 2, 3];
 
_.reverse(array);
// => [3, 2, 1]
 
console.log(array);
// => [3, 2, 1]```
